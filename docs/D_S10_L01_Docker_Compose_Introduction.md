## 1 Docker Compose - Introduction
---

## Overview of Docker Compose (1)
 - docker-compose is a tool for defining and running multiple containers on a Docker host.
 - A YAML file is used to configure the containers. 
 - With a single command `docker-compose up`, you create and start all the containers defined in your yml file.

---

## Overview of Docker Compose (2) 
 - YAML file is used to define:
   - containers
   - networks
   - volumes
 - docker-compose is mainly used for development purposes. 
 - The yml files can be used on a production environment with Docker Swarm. 
 - docker-compose.yml is the default filename but any file name can be used with `docker-compose -f`.
